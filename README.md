# NowPlayingOverlay

A very simple & clean music overlay, based on [Zyphen's Now Playing Overlay](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/zyphens-now-playing-overlay.1026/).

While Zyphen's version supports Tuna, I have modified mine in such a way that it only supports Snip. I might update the overlay in the future, but for now, only Snip is supported.

## Snip Instructions
1. Download & install [Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip).
2. Run & authorize it with your Spotify account.
3. Right-click the Snip icon in your Notification Area (a.k.a. System Tray), and ensure your settings match this: ![Snip settings](https://i.imgur.com/NuGh999.png)
