# NowPlayingOverlay

A very simple, clean, & animated music overlay. (based on [Zyphen's Now Playing Overlay](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/zyphens-now-playing-overlay.1026/))

While Zyphen's version supports Tuna, I have modified mine in such a way that it only supports Snip. I might update the overlay in the future, but for now, only Snip is supported.

## Snip Instructions
1. Download & install [Snip](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip).
2. Run & authorize it with your Spotify account.
3. Right-click the Snip icon in your Notification Area (a.k.a. System Tray), and ensure your settings match this:

## Overlay Instructions
1. Download my [latest release](https://github.com/kehlankrumme/NowPlayingOverlay/releases/latest).
2. Move `Song.html` into the same folder as `Snip.exe`.

## Open Broadcaster Software Instructions
1. Add a Browser source.
2. Your settings should look like this, just make sure that `Local File` matches the path to `Song.html` in your Snip folder:
